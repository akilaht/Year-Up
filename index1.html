	<p>Mulan has been one of my favorite movies since I was a little girl. I love the fact that the man character is a women in a male dominated culture. She did not let the fact that she is a women stop her from achieving her goal. Also, the fact that she risked her life to save her fathers is so admirable and really shows her strength.</p>
